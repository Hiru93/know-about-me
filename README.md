# know-about-me — Web CV · Mattia Gallinaro

A personal web CV built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, designed to be shared with recruiters and tech leads who want to learn more about my profile before scheduling an interview.

## Purpose

- **Technical skills** — React, Angular, TypeScript, Node.js, cloud-native architectures (GCP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes) and more
- **Work experience** — a timeline of my collaborations with companies like Exabyte, M31, SCAI ITEC, reMedia and Trizeta, with context on my role and the technologies involved in each project
- **Education & background** — Computer Science studies at the University of Padova and a diploma as IT Technician
