Throughout my career I have built deep expertise in <react>React</react>, <angular>Angular</angular> and <nodejs>Node.js</nodejs>, working on microservices architectures and containerised environments on Google Cloud Platform and AWS. I am driven by a strong focus on code quality, best practices and continuous improvement, combined with a natural inclination towards collaboration and knowledge sharing within Agile teams.",
    "hobbies_label": "Passions & Interests",
    "hobbies_text": "Alongside the technical side I cultivate passions of a true nerd. I am a fan of Magic: The Gathering, of which I love first and foremost the purely artistic aspect from which it originates, and I am a regular of the Italian (and not only) Premodern tournament scene. Part of my free time, however, is also dedicated to Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, of which I am an avid collector and player. Rounding out my profile is a passion for board games, which has led me and my partner to collect and play as many as over 150 of them (and yes, we have really played them all :D)."
